# About Me:
I worked as a quality control engineer at a company that is engaged in high-precision machining. But now I want to try something new. I am sure that the acquired
skills (such as attentiveness) and innate ability (such as diligence) will help me quickly learn how to write correct and readable code/quickly find and fix bugs.

# Skills:
* __Git__ (Beginner)
* __HTML__ (Beginner)
* __CSS__ (Beginner)
* __C++__ (Beginner)

# Code example:
        {
        setlocale( LC_ALL, "rus" );
         int a, P;
    	    cout<<"Введите сторону квадрата а: ";
    	    cin >>a;
    	    P=4*a;
    	    cout<<"Периметр квадрата равен  "<<P<<endl;
    	    system("pause");
        }
